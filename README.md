# REACT Tdoo Application
Small application for handling your daily tasks.

## Introduction
Reason for writing Tdoo is to replicate the same app from VueJS in React.
    https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html

The project will iterate in several phases rasing each time number of features.
List of planned features is in TODO.md file.
This should be translated to React Native as well.

## Versioning 
Application Version is written in the following files:
- /components/Header.js
- package.json
- /public/index.html > title 

## Application Demo
You can check the demo version here: 

[TDoo Zero - DEMO](http://www.tdoo.co.uk/tdoo-v0)

and use it at your convenience.

More things to come in future, so stay in touch ...

## Suggest a Feature
Is there something you'd like to see in tdoo-v0?

Maybe in a newer version, we could implement some of those.
For the future, we definitely need to build a voting system that will tell us what is the feature you like the most and would like to see it implemented first.
